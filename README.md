[![Ansible Lint](https://github.com/coredotbin/infra/actions/workflows/ansible_lint.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coredotbin/infra/actions/workflows/ansible_lint.yaml)

Very basic Ansible to configure and deploy my home infrastructure, primarily based around Docker.

Credit to IronicBadger/AlexKTZ - this is heavily based on [his infra repo](https://github.com/ironicbadger/infra) and utilizing his awesome [docker_compose_generator](https://github.com/IronicBadger/ansible-role-docker-compose-generator) Ansible role.

Also credit to mrts for his [docker-postgresql-multiple-databases](https://github.com/mrts/docker-postgresql-multiple-databases) script, which I have [forked](https://github.com/coredotbin/docker-postgresql-multiple-databases) for my own uses in this project.
